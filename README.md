# SeirChain: The Triad Matrix - A Fractal Ledger for Quantum-Resistant Decentralization

## ?? Introduction

SeirChain is a groundbreaking **Triad Matrix prototype** that re-imagines decentralized ledger technology. It moves beyond traditional linear **chains** by implementing a **fractal ledger** based on the principles of **Sierpinski triangles**. This innovative design aims to address critical challenges in ledger scalability, efficiency, and future-proof its cryptographic foundation against emerging quantum threats.

At its core, SeirChain organizes transactions and **Triads** into a self-similar, infinitely expanding, yet spatially constrained, fractal pattern. This unique architecture facilitates parallel processing and provides a novel approach to securing decentralized information exchange within a **functional prototype of a Triad Matrix**.

## ✨ Features

* **Fractal Ledger Architecture (Triad Matrix):** Utilizes Sierpinski triangles for scalable and efficient data organization, **demonstrated through a working Triad Matrix structure**.
* **Proof-of-Work (PoW) Mining:** Secures the **Triad Matrix** through computational puzzle-solving, **simulating real-world mining difficulty**. New **Triads** are mined and added to the **Matrix**.
* **Configurable Networks:** Supports distinct `testnet` and `mainnet` environments with adjustable parameters like mining difficulty and **Matrix** depth.
* **Architectural Quantum Preparedness:** Designed to allow modular integration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, **showcasing a forward-looking design**.
* **Wallet Management:** Basic wallet functionality for address generation and balance tracking.
* **ASCII Visualization:** Provides a textual visualization of the fractal ledger structure.

## ?? Getting Started

Follow these steps to get SeirChain and its Triad Matrix up and running quickly on your local machine.

### Quick Start (Automated Setup)

The easiest way to set up SeirChain is by using the automated quick start script. This script will clone the repository, create a Python virtual environment, and install all necessary dependencies.

1.  **Ensure you have Python 3 and Git installed.**
2.  **Run the quick start script:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/seirchain.git](https://github.com/your-username/seirchain.git) # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd seirchain
    chmod +x quick_start_setup.sh # Make the script executable
    ./quick_start_setup.sh
    ```

    * **Note:** If `git clone` fails because the directory already exists, simply `cd seirchain` and then run `chmod +x quick_start_setup.sh && ./quick_start_setup.sh` inside the existing directory.

### Manual Installation

For a detailed, step-by-step manual installation guide, including troubleshooting tips, please refer to the comprehensive [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) document.

## ▶️ Running Simulations

Once SeirChain is set up, you can generate the genesis **Triad** and run simulations for different network configurations of the **Triad Matrix**.

First, make sure your virtual environment is active:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
