Enhancement Plan Checklist for Sophisticated and Robust Improvements

miner.py:
- [x] Implement graceful shutdown:
  - [x] Add a threading.Event to signal shutdown.
  - [x] Modify mining loops to check this event and exit cleanly.
- [x] Thread lifecycle management:
  - [x] Track thread states and ensure proper join on stop.
- [x] Metrics collection:
  - [x] Add counters for hashes computed, successful mines, mining duration.
  - [x] Expose metrics via properties or logging.
- [x] Nonce search strategy:
  - [x] Use randomized nonce start points or partition nonce ranges per thread.
- [x] Configuration validation:
  - [x] Validate DIFFICULTY, MAX_NONCE_ATTEMPTS, and thread count on startup.
- [x] Transaction pool handling:
  - [x] Validate transactions before adding to pool.
  - [x] Deduplicate transactions in pool.

simulate.py:
- [x] Configuration validation:
  - [x] Check all config parameters for valid ranges and types.
- [x] Modularize:
  - [x] Separate wallet initialization, transaction generation, and simulation loop into functions.
- [x] Metrics and logging:
  - [x] Log transaction rates, wallet balances periodically.
- [x] Pause/resume:
  - [x] Implement signal handlers or flags to pause and resume simulation.
- [x] Error recovery:
  - [x] Retry failed operations with backoff.

data_types/base.py:
- [ ] Immutability:
  - [ ] Use @dataclass(frozen=True) or implement __setattr__ to prevent mutation.
- [ ] Validation:
  - [ ] Check hash formats (length, hex), depth non-negative.
- [ ] Serialization:
  - [ ] Add from_dict and to_dict with error handling.
- [ ] Equality:
  - [ ] Implement __eq__ and __hash__ for Triad and Transaction.

wallet_manager.py:
- [ ] Encryption:
  - [ ] Stub methods for encrypting/decrypting private keys.
- [ ] Address validation:
  - [ ] Add checksum validation (e.g., EIP-55 style).
- [ ] Concurrency:
  - [ ] Use threading.Lock for wallet updates.
- [ ] Logging:
  - [ ] Add detailed logs for balance changes and transfers.
- [ ] Signature verification:
  - [ ] Add stub method for verifying transaction signatures.

General:
- [ ] Unit tests:
  - [ ] Add tests for mining, simulation, data types, wallet operations.
- [ ] Code style:
  - [ ] Enforce PEP8 and docstring standards.
- [ ] Logging:
  - [ ] Use configurable log levels and formats.
- [ ] Input sanitization:
  - [ ] Validate all external inputs and handle exceptions gracefully.
