Expanded Plan:
- Fix existing errors and exceptions in core files, including edge cases and concurrency issues.
- Refactor code for clarity, consistency, maintainability, and performance improvements.
- Standardize attribute names and data structures across modules.
- Enhance logging with appropriate log levels and contextual information.
- Improve thread safety and synchronization in mining and networking components.
- Verify and improve transaction handling consistency across wallet_manager, ledger, and miner.
- Add validation and error handling for network communication and data serialization.
- Review configuration usage and ensure defaults and overrides are handled properly.
- Add unit tests or integration tests where missing to cover critical functionality.
- Optimize data loading and saving mechanisms for ledger and wallets.
- Ensure graceful startup and shutdown sequences for node and miner.
- Document key classes and methods for maintainability.
- Prepare for future extensibility by modularizing code where possible.

Dependent files to be edited:
- seirchain/network/node.py
- seirchain/triangular_ledger/triangular_ledger.py
- seirchain/data_types/triad.py
- seirchain/wallet_manager.py
- seirchain/miner.py
- seirchain/triangular_ledger/triangle.py

Follow-up steps:
- Run comprehensive tests and simulations to verify fixes and refactoring.
- Monitor logs for errors or warnings during operation.
- Provide a summary report of changes and improvements made.

Additional Deployment and Archiving Plan Checklist:

[x] 1. Run the genesis generation script (run_genesis.sh) for testnet.
[x] 2. Run the genesis generation script (run_genesis.sh) for mainnet.
[x] 3. Move ledger_testnet.json to archive/ directory.
[x] 4. Move ledger_mainnet.json to archive/ directory.
[x] 5. Create .gitignore file in root directory.
[x] 6. Add ledger_testnet.json, ledger_mainnet.json, and archive/ directory to .gitignore.
[x] 7. Verify that genesis ledgers are archived and ignored by git.

This checklist will help track progress and assist successors in understanding the deployment and archiving process.
